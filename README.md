[Assignment](http://apps.mprog.nl/projects/student-s-choice-android)


## Proposal

I will be making an app for the store of the franchise [Kippie](www.kippie.nl) in my hometown. With the app the user can check which allergens are in which products. With the app the user can also keep track of the current special offers.

### Main features
* List of products with filter function. The user can filter by allergens, category, price etc.
* Search bar to find products by name.
* Different activity for the special offers. Slideshow of the posters for the special offers.

### Extra features
* An extra activity for the user to order some of the special products we have in store.
* Another app for my boss so he can easily change information in the allergens app.

## Release
The apk can be found in Kippie/KippieAllergenen/app/app-release.apk

I did not manage to implement a filter function for the list of products, everything else works.


## Documentation
To use the app just download the apk and install it. 

**The app:**

**Menu**

To get the menu you only need to slide your finger from the left of the screen to the right, or press the icon at the top of the screen.

**Allergenen**

Select the "Allergenen" item in the menu. Scroll through the list of products or just type the product in the searchbar. Pressing on a product will show a popup with all the information about the product.

Select the "Pan bestellen" item in the menu. Choose a "pan" from the drop down menu, fill in the preferences for the "pan", fill in the personal information and press "bestellen". You will need to choose your e-mail app. The e-mail is already filled in, you only need to press send to send the order.
