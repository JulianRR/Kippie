## Proposal

I will be making an app for the store of the franchise [Kippie](www.kippie.nl) in my hometown. With the app the user can check which allergens are in which products. With the app the user can also keep track of the current special offers.

### Main features
* List of products with filter function. The user can filter by allergens, category, price etc.
* Search bar to find products by name.
* Different activity for the special offers. Slideshow of the posters for the special offers.

### Extra features
* An extra activity for the user to order some of the special products we have in store.
* Another app for my boss so he can easily change information in the allergens app.
