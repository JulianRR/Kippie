[Assignment](http://apps.mprog.nl/projects/student-s-choice-android)


## Proposal

I will be making an app for the store of the franchise [Kippie](www.kippie.nl) in my hometown. With the app the user can check which allergens are in which products. With the app the user can also keep track of the current special offers.

### Main features
* List of products with filter function. The user can filter by allergens, category, price etc.
* Search bar to find products by name.
* Different activity for the special offers. Slideshow of the posters for the special offers.

### Extra features
* An extra activity for the user to order some of the special products we have in store.
* Another app for my boss so he can easily change information in the allergens app.

## Release
The apk can be found in Kippie/KippieAllergenen/app/app-release.apk

I did not manage to implement a filter function for the list of products, everything else works.


## Documentation
To use the app just download the apk and install it. 

The app:
Menu
To get the menu you only need to slide your finger from the left of the screen to the right, or press the icon at the top of the screen.
